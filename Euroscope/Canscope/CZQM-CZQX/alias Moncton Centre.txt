.info This is an information message. Moncton-CZQM and Gander-CZQX are one FIR.  When Gander is offline, Moncton covers the airspace and vice-versa.  If you are using VatSpy, please note that there has been no updates, nor support since 2010 for that software.  We recommend Vattastic.com for updated airspace information.  Please visit us at CZQM.CA for more information. Thanks for flying with us!

.afk Due to the Cross the Pont Event and the heavy amount of traffic on one frequency, please do not ask/announce any AFKs. You are responsible for maintaining your presence at the controls.
